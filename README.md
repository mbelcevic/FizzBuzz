# FizzBuzz - 100 days of Python day 4 challenge

This script implements the classic FizzBuzz game. It defines a function fizzbuzz(a, b) that prints numbers from a to b-1 with the following rules:

- Prints "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3.
- Prints "Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5.
- Prints "FizzBuzz" if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5.

Otherwise, it prints the number itself.

## Usage
To use this script, you need to call the fizzbuzz(a, b) function with two arguments:
a: The starting number of the range (inclusive).
b: The ending number of the range (exclusive).

The script will print the FizzBuzz sequence for the specified range.
